    <ol><li>Fork the repository and copy one of the starter template folders. Rename it and set the same slug in <code>template.yaml</code>.</li><li>Add your name, public contact link, description, features, license, compatibility, and entrypoint concept. List images with useful alt text and list source files in evaluation order.</li><li>Keep the application’s Tonk notation in its own YAML files. Include everything needed for a fresh space, and mark sample data optional.</li><li>Run <code>npm ci</code>, <code>npm test</code>, and <code>npm run build</code>. Try the app in a fresh Tonk space and describe the checks in your pull request.</li><li>Open a pull request. A maintainer reviews the source and merges it into the collection.</li></ol>
    <h2>Show what people will get</h2><p>Include at least one clear image. Screenshots are best; label interface illustrations as illustrations. The collection shows your first image; detail pages preview up to five images in the order you list them. All images are included in the download and catalog. Use images you have permission to share.</p>
    <h2>Keep it useful</h2><p>Explain setup, network access, dependencies, and anything that changes existing data. Use distinct names for concepts and commands. Keep credentials and private data out of the contribution.</p>
